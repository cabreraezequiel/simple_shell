# Welcome to our Shell!

In computing, a shell is a computer program which exposes an operating system's services to a human user or other programs. In general, operating system shells use either a command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI), depending on a computer's role and particular operation. It is named a shell because it is the outermost layer around the operating system.

Command-line shells require the user to be familiar with commands and their calling syntax, and to understand concepts about the shell-specific scripting language (for example, bash).

Graphical shells place a low burden on beginning computer users, and are characterized as being easy to use. Since they also come with certain disadvantages, most GUI-enabled operating systems also provide CLI shells.

This is a command-line shell.

## What our shell does.

The shell is the Linux command line interpreter. It provides an interface between the user and the kernel and executes programs called commands. For example, if a user enters ls then the shell executes the ls command.

```bash
[MyShell]$ ls -l /bin/ls
```

## Usage

```python
root@799c59932583:/home/simple_shell/# ls -l /bin/ls
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 142144 Sep  5  2019 /bin/ls
```
